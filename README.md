# Constellation Recognition Software

## The idea of the project is analysing star data in order to recognize constellation patterns in the sky, using computer vision.

### This is an AI constellation recognition project, using unsupervised learning computer vision with a YOLOv8 model. The dataset is available on roboflow to download.
