# Constellation Recognition Software

## The idea of the project is analysing star data in order to recognize constellation patterns in the sky, using computer vision.

### We want to build an AI star pattern recognition/constellation recognition, using unsupervised learning computer vision (cnn) with tensorflow, pytorch, Scipy or OpenCV. Our project will identify constellations in the night sky.
