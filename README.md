# Constellation Recognition Software
## The idea of the project is analysing star data in order to recognize constellation patterns in the sky, using computer vision.

### We want to build an AI star pattern recognition/constellation recognition, using unsupervised learning(clusters)computer vision (cnn) with tensorflow, pytorch, Scipy or OpenCV. The data that we want to use is Star maps from NASA, ESA, or open datasets like Stellarium. Our project will either detect hidden patterns and star clusters and find new contellations based on density and brightness, or simply recognize constellations in the night sky. Some weak points can be the difficulty of identifying the star clusters, so we will take that into account when making our final decision.
